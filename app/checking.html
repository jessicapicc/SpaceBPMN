            <div id="question-1" class="opacity_0 hidden question-explained">In general, fCM should be used when the process is semi-structured. That means, the process should consist of multiple structured parts, i.e., sequences of activities and events that are always executed together, that can be combined in different ways to create a multitude of possible execution paths to achieve the process goal.</div>
            
            <div class="question"><p class="question-text">Has your model data-driven decisions?</p><div class="triangle" onclick="changeclass('question-2')">&#x25BC</div></div>
            <div id="question-2" class="opacity_0 hidden question-explained">Decisions and process progression are highly dependent on data/knowledge obtained during execution rather then previously executed activities. Based on this information, the decision space is defined at each point in time, reducing the number of different options available regarding the continuation of the process. Knowledge in general evolves during process execution, i.e., enriching data objects with discovered knowledge.</div>
            
            <div class="question"><p class="question-text">Is your model goal-oriented?</p><div class="triangle" onclick="changeclass('question-3')">&#x25BC</div></div>
            <div id="question-3" class="opacity_0 hidden question-explained">The goal of the process is to gain knowledge/enrich data objects rather than executing/reaching certain activities. Following data-drivenness, process termination is determined by data state instead of previously executed activities. Therefore, the designer should be able to capture this goal with a set of data objects in certain states.</div>
            
            <div class="question"><p class="question-text">Is your model defined by domain experts' decisions?</p><div class="triangle" onclick="changeclass('question-4')">&#x25BC</div></div>
            <div id="question-4" class="opacity_0 hidden question-explained">The process execution is highly dependent on the (tacit) knowledge of a domain expert. This expert drives the process execution and decides, based on the data available combined with his/her domain expertise, on the next activities when different options are available. This is different from other approaches where a system decides on the execution path..</div>
