Title:
Booking System

Description:
This collaboration concerns with the management of a hotel booking involving three participants: the Customer, the Booking System, and the Hotel.
The collaboration represents a scenario in which the Customer interacts with the Booking System in order to get a list of hotel quotes for a desired travel.
To serve the customer request, the Booking System creates a process instance. This, in its turn, sends multiple requests to the Hotel pool, thus creating many instances of this latter participant.
The Booking System collects the quotes for the Customer and sends them to him. Finally, the Customer communicates the selected hotel to the Booking System,
which consequently gives a feedback to both selected and discarded Hotel instances.
