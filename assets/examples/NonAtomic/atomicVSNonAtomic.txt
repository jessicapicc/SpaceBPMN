Title:
AtomicVSNonAtomic

Description:
The diagram provides a minimal example showing the impact of task type on the overall process execution.
The process consists in performing firstly Task A then, concurrently Task B and Task C, when both complete the process ends.
All the tasks can access to the data object Data that contains three fields a, b, and c. Moreover considering guard and
assignments we refer to the following specification. Task A has no guard condition and makes the assignment Data.a = 1.
Both Task B and Task C have the same guard condition that is Data.a == 0. Regarding assignments, Task B performs Data.b = 2
and Data.a = 0, while Task C makes Data.c = 5 and Data.a = 0.
